# Secure-AES-Vault
The primary goal of the Secure AES Vault is to empower users with a simple, accessible, and secure method for protecting sensitive documents before sharing them. It functions as a secure utility for generating encrypted files (.enc) that can be safely transmitted over insecure channels, relying on a separately shared secret key for decryption.
